## Corona-Mask-Classifier
Image Recognition Model that detects whether the person has worn the mask or not

### Corona Mask Classifier helps predict whether the person has worn the mask or not. It is a convolutional neural network model that detects whether the person has worn the mask.
The working of this model is not satisfactory, I am exploring different techniques to improve its accuracy.
